# Discord Bot - RISK
this project is a discord bot to play Risk - The Boardgame

# setup
You can run `main.py` to initiate the program. When it runs for the first time it will ask for your discord-bot token, then it saves it into a `.env` file. The next time you run the program will automatically get the token from here.
